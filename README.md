# Chutes n' Ladders Autoplayer
I wanted to know how quickly one could beat Chutes n' Ladders and what you'd have to spin to do it. I imagine this information exists on the Internet, but I had to figure it out myself.

Turns out, 7 spins can win! There are numerous spin variations to do it in 7, but you always have to start with a 1 (which ladders you to 38).

# Give it a spin
1. Grab the repo
1. Install `jasmine` with `npm install -g jasmine`
1. `cd` to the repo and run `jasmine`
